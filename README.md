# FlashMem_Simulator_2.0

<img src="/res/pgb-flashmemory.png" width="200" height="133"><br></br>
NAND Flash Memory Simulater for Block Mapping Method with 2 Types of Mapping Table, Hybrid Mapping Method (BAST : Block Associative Sector Translation - 1:2 Block level mapping with Dynamic Table)

	1) Static Table : Mapping table initially all correspond 1 : 1 (Logical Sector or Block Num -> Physical Sector or Block Num)
	2) Dynamic Table : Mapping table initially all empty (non-assigned)

â€» Additional implementation

	- Garbage Collecter
		=> Because the cost of erasing operations is greater than reading and writing, 
		freeing up space for recording during idle time or through garbage collection at an appropriate time.

	- Trace function
		=> Performance test through write operation by specific pattern.

<h3><strong>< Build Option ></strong></h3><br>

- Modify this predefined macro as you want (Refer to "Build_Options.h")

| Predefined Macro | For What |
|:---|:---|
| DEBUG_MODE | Trace all possible error situations (annotate to disable) |
| PAGE_TRACE_MODE | Trace wear-leveling per sector (page) for all physical sectors (pages) (annotate to disable) |
| BLOCK_TRACE_MODE | Trace wear-leveling per block for all physical blocks (annotate to disable) |
| SPARE_BLOCK_RATIO | The rate of spare blocks to be managed by the system for the total number of blocks (Blocks that cannot be record data directly) (Default : 0.08, 8%) |
| VICTIM_BLOCK_QUEUE_RATIO | Set the size of the Victim Block Queue to the ratio size of the total number of blocks in the generated flash memory (Default : 0.08, 8%) |
| VICTIM_BLOCK_DEBUG_MODE | Garbage Collector does not process the selected Victim Block after the end of the write operation (annotate to disable) |
